## 1. The Problem

Healthcare has a multifaceted **information problem**:

### Custody

Health data primarily concerns patients, and patients do not have custody of their own data. When patients change medical service providers, they cannot easily share their old data with their new doctors. This introduces new costs to all parties, as it requires patients to pay for new tests, doctors to perform them, administrators to record them, and insurance companies to cover all of the above.

### Fragmentation

No single point of contact exists for all of a patient’s health data. My own health data is currently spread across 6 different service providers. In the last five years, I have repeated the same lab tests at multiple institutions since data was not shareable without friction.

### Duplication

Every medical service provider and insurance company maintains its own database.  Much of this data is duplicated, giving rise to an entire industry: claim filing.

### Centralization

Maintaining databases is difficult. To reduce costs, service providers and patients alike are incentivized toward centralization.

**On the supply side: **A new medical school graduate wants to run her own practice, but she has no experience maintaining complex health databases, so she joins a large hospital.

**On the demand side:** You already see a doctor at Stanford Hospital for your knee, but you want to see a new doctor for your back. Because Stanford’s central EPIC healthcare database already contains your data, you decide to find a new doctor at Stanford.

These supply-side and demand-side centralization forces result in the unnatural growth of medical organizations, making healthcare more corporate and less personal.

### Isolation

Health care data is isolated by the boundaries of the organization in which it is stored. Thus, researchers only have access to partial data for each patient.

This "information problem" leads to another problem: 

### Increased administrative costs 

Administrative costs are skyrocketing as a percentage of total healthcare costs.

## 2. Why the problem exists

These problems did not develop due to malice or bad actors in the system.

They developed because **we did not have the technology to maintain an immutable database without a central organization.**

The innovations presented in the Bitcoin paper (NOTE:  https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ) and the subsequent success of the Bitcoin network prove that we can now run a decentralized, trustless database for value storage, communication, and computation. 

Now that we have the technology we need, we face a different problem:

### The gatekeepers of today’s data have no incentive to innovate.

![image alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/healthchain/wiki/master/images/whitepaper/image_3.png)

How they benefit from fragmented data:

Hopsitals

Private practices

Labs

Pharmacies

Insurance companies

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)

Surescripts

Drug manufacturers

All of this leads to increased healthcare costs for the consumer:

## 3. How will decentralization help?

A decentralized health network (NOTE:  For an  centralized alternative see ELGA in Austria [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://www.bmgf.gv.at/cms/home/attachments/1/7/2/CH1538/CMS1458292318057/1511_elga_the_electronic_health_record_in_austria.pdf ) will allow us to accomplish the following:

### Give health data custody to patients

Giving custody of health data to patients will remove many market imperfections.

Currently, every patient's data is spread across numerous health care clinics, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, and insurance companies. 

Patient custody will allow the sharing of health data across organizational boundaries, dramatically increasing transparency and efficiency while maintaining privacy.

### Create new efficiencies 

* Patients who join the healthchain network will be able to effortlessly share data generated by wearable devices with their doctors.

* An HL7 interface will allow easy data import and export

* API development on the healthchain platform enables a new app ecosystem

### Reduce the cost of health insurance

With all of my information stored on a decentralized, tamper-proof database, I can easily give insurance companies access to my health data and allow them to compete for my choice of insurance policy. This innovation may even lead to peer-to-peer insurance exchanges, where individuals could bid to insure me.

### Lift the burden of database management from doctors

A new graduate will not need to run a central EHR system. Since the data is now decentralized, she will be able to see the complete medical data of each patient. 

### Make healthcare more personal and less corporate

Without the burden of database management, new doctors will find it easier to run a more personal private clinic.

### Reduce cost of medications 

Once your prescription is on HealthChain, pharmacies compete to offer you the best price for your medications, which are then shipped to your door.

The only reason we do not have this innovation already is that patients do not yet have custody of their data.

### Enable better pharmacy integration

First world problem of Savant Care spending 1.5 years of development effort.

Developing world problem of there being no infrastructure.

Deliver savings to pharmacies (most profits go to PBMs).

### Reduce cost by catching insurance fraud 

When health data is stored in a blockchain database, a clinic will not be able to bill two patients from two different insurance companies seeing the same provider at the same time.

### Enable better research

Imagine a future where a researcher from Stanford announces that they will pay 1 token to every cancer patient who makes available their medical records for a new cancer study. The patients interested add the public key of Stanford University, and their medical data immediately becomes available to the researcher.

### Enable better diagnosis

I suffer from sleep apnea. Currently, I see a sleep doctor at Stanford and I find it very hard to pursue a second opinion, as the process of sharing my medical data from Stanford with another doctor is too cumbersome. With HealthChain, I will be able to seek a second opinion just be adding the public key of another doctor to my health records.

### Enable better lab integration

First world problem of labs refusing to integrate with Savant Care since we were too small.

Developing world problem of there being no infrastructure.    	   

### Enable community around diseases

I would like to participate in a community of others with similar health profile like mine.

### Launch new era of database efficiency:

* Reduced costs of data storage (IPFS allows decentralized storage of petabytes of data)

* Easier scalability

* Lower latency

* Customers no longer worry that their data will be mined

* Preservation of data no longer depends on any single service provider staying in business

### Ensure immutability of data via blockchain

### Larger impact in developing countries compared to developed countries

## 4. How will tokenization help?

By offering tokens that carry real value, HealthChain participants can "defibrillate" the healthcare industry out of inertia by creating marketplaces where none had existed before.

This allows us to present HealthChain to all market participants as an opportunity to profit, rather than as an obstacle to it. The last thing we want is for market participants to feel we exist merely to bully them into obsolescence with flashy new technology.

Tokenization also allows Healthchain to accomplish the following:

### Enable the network effect

The value of health tokens is backed by the business they create: protocol development, and the exchange of data between healthchain entities.

### Deliver savings to pharmacies

The average retail pharmacy’s profit margin is around 12%, as most profit is captured by PBMs.

### Incentivize early adopters

Tokenization allows HealthChain to reward users who believe in our vision and are willing to provide the initial spark of momentum. 

### ‘Bootstrap’ the network

A fair accounting system that reflects each person's contribution is essential for inspiring participation in the HealthChain community.

### Enable value exchange in the market	    	     

Healthchain is a market, with patients in control of their data on the supply side and researchers who want access to the data on the demand side. Introducing a currency enables value exchange in the market.

### Maintain value as reward for behavior

If your government passes a law requiring the use of HealthChain’s decentralized health care database, tokens will retain their value, as they allow us to reward desired behaviors and encourage improvements in prescription non-compliance and lifestyle diseases, each of which constitutes a significant percentage of healthcare costs. 

## 5. The HealthChain network

The access privileges and costs to the various users of the HealthChain network will be as follows:

**Patients:**

* Receive tokens when they download the HealthChain app

* Can write their wearable data on to the health chain for free

* Get free access to all of their health data on the health chain

* Receive paid offers from researchers to access de-identified health data 

**Medical service providers (e.g., hospitals, clinics, labs):**

* Receive tokens when they write data on healthchain

* Can read/write data onto healthchain for free

**Pharmacies:**

* Bid on each prescription for free

* Pay 1 HealthBit (0.01 HealthTokens) to health chain foundation for each accepted bid

**Researchers:**

* Choose their own price for their research project, and pay:

* 90% of this price to participating patients

* 10% to the health chain foundation

Because the value is in the network, we want "health ecosystem participants," i.e., patients and medical service providers to join the network as easily as possible. The larger their number, the greater the value of the network. A large network entices market participants to adopt healthchain as industry protocol. (NOTE: Note: We will not allow advertisements of any kind on the network. We want health decisions to be based only on the efficacy of a treatment and its appropriateness for each patient, not on an entity’s ability to buy advertisements.)

Our philosophy is that only entities that immediately and directly profit from access to the network should pay a fee. For example, if 5 pharmacies place bids to fill your prescription, only the winning pharmacy pays a fee. This arrangement encourages more pharmacies to bid on patient prescriptions and begin to profit from healthchain right away.

We ask different transaction costs for pharmacies and researchers because for pharmacies, the value is in the fulfillment of prescriptions, which comes from access to the database but not from the data itself. For researchers, the value is in the data itself.

## 6. The value of health tokens

Each year, approximately 4 billion prescriptions are written in the United States, and another 10 billion worldwide for a total of 14 billion. Recall that 1 HealthBit = 0.01 Health Tokens. If every pharmacy around the globe uses HealthChain to bid on prescriptions, the HealthChain Foundation will receive 140 million Health Tokens per year.

**These 140 million Health tokens are like a central bank withdrawing supply from the economy.** This will maintain the demand for Health tokens.

If the patient research data market in USD is 10 billion USD, and Health tokens are valued at 1 USD each, the HealthChain Foundation will earn 1 billion Health Tokens by providing researchers with access to health data.

Thus, the HealthChain Foundation can sell  ~1.2 billion Health Tokens in the market each year.

How much will the market be willing to pay for these 1.2 billion Health tokens?

Say we assume that the market is willing to pay 1% of the transaction volume. Subsequently, we assume that the pharmacy market is worth 1000 billion dollars.

Hence the value of 1.2 billion Health tokens will be approx. 11 billion dollars.

## 7. The Nonprofit HealthChain Foundation

We cannot possibly anticipate all of the needs and market structures that will shape the healthcare industry of the future.

Therefore, we are establishing the HealthChain foundation, a nonprofit organization that will use health tokens to incentivize market participants entrenched in outdated healthcare data markets to join the HealthChain ecosystem.

The Foundation will also use the Healthbits earned from pharmacies and researchers to fund ongoing software development within the HealthChain protocol, pay for storage on the Filecoin network, and cover other maintenance needs.

The HealthChain foundation will be responsible for the following:

1. Incentivizing desired behavior among market participants

2. Long-term network governance 

3. Raising required capital

4. Academic research through grants 

5. Community-building


## 8. How many tokens will be issued?

* 80% of tokens are given to the nonprofit HealthChain Foundation.

* 20% of tokens are given to HealthChain founders for incubating the idea of HealthChain and getting a perpetual license to their technology of health modeling language, emr, patient portal, hl7 engine and pharmacy network integration. 6 year linear vesting schedule. For research, engineering, license to SC EMR.

## 9. The Team

Our team previously founded Savant Care, an outpatient psychiatry practice in Palo Alto that also conducts research and development of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and artificial intelligence for use in tracking and predicting mental health issues. We also created a complete Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software that features a conversational UI.

Dr. Savant has just released the world's first personal health record software that uses IPFS for storage and the blockchain to guarantee immutability and ordering of the data.

## 10. Why HealthChain is the best blockchain solution for healthcare

![image alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/healthchain/wiki/master/images/whitepaper/image_5.png)

## 11. What are the release phases?

### Patient custody of healthcare data.

Log into website. Fax to health care provider. They fax back the health care data in the data interchange format agreed by the industry.  (NOTE:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources )

Five benefits:

1. Now you can take this data when you go to a new health care provider. Or you can enter the provider's health care details and we will send the data to them.

2. You can either pro-bono or for value give access to de-identified data to medical researchers.

3. Easy availability of data will enable easily getting 2nd opinion.

4. Not be forced to stick to one institution and can easily switch healthcare providers. Or go to a different specialist. Not be stuck to a medical institution because your medical record is there.

5. You can make Insurance companies bid on insuring you. Now they can look at your data and give you insurance quotes.

### Life style disease behavior modification

Connect blockchain to health monitoring devices and give health tokens for positive behavior.

### Use blockchain to improve the lab integration

### Use blockchain to improve the pharmacy integration 

### Use blockchain to enable medical charitable giving.

### Remove the claim filing industry 

Since now the traditional insurance companies can see claims through this central database. Coding will still remain.

### Deploy a distributed EHR using Savant Care tech

Delivered over the ipfs network to interact with this data. Private practices will not need to buy EHR softwares any more.

### How will you overcome the UX of PKI?

Users will log into the system with a password. This will generate a private key on the fly. The key will be stored only on the client side and will not be sent to the server.  (NOTE:  http://wwwtyro.github.io/cryptico/ )

## 12. What success looks like

When my patient says, "Send my prescription to healthchain"

When my patient tells me, "You can get my medical history on healthchain"

When I can get my patient’s previous test results on healthchain instead of ordering new tests

When I get a flier in the mail offering me lower health insurance rates

When my next prescription is being filled by a pharmacy in the town next door, because they bid for the lowest cost with next-day delivery 

When I earn $100 this year from offering my de-identified health data to medical researchers

When I can find 1000 patients with matching criteria for my study on "melatonin usage in delirium" instantly, instead of waiting for 6+ months

## 13. Will the token sale be open to US investors?

We have to answer 2 key questions:
1. Is this a utility token
2. Do we have protections in place for AML.

Health token is like api keys to access the health chain network. The pharmacists need it to fill prescriptions and the researchers need it to buy data.

Also, the software is working before the launch of the network.

Before buying the tokens we ask for the identity of the person contributing.

Each person should consult his/her own legal advisor. 

## 14. What technology will you use?

### Blockchain

#### Option 1: Etherium

-ves:

1. Each transaction would cost gas.

#### Option 2: Fork of steem

-ves:

1. Significantly more development effort.

### Identity

#### Option 1: uPort. 

-ves:

My mom will find uport hard to use. 

#### Option 2: steemit

Easier to use compared to uPort

### Data Storage

IPFS file system with API’s to read and write medical data. Use IPNS to get to the latest data.

### Encryption

Medical data before being put on the IPFS is encrypted using the public key of the patient. So that only the patient can decrypt it.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianopolous/Peergos/master/papers/wuala-cryptree.pdf 

Use chain of trust to give access to a larger group of people.

Patients can add the public key of a person they want to give access to their data.

### Frontend

React/angualrjs

## 17. What will be the model of initial token sale?

A proposal was made to the foundation to sell 120 million tokens. Price per token  = CEILING(HLT sold in M/8)*0.25. This proposal passed.

## 18. How will the health tokens be used?

Medical service providers (Hospitals, private clinics, Labs) and patients can read/write data onto the health chain for free.

Why?

We want health chain protocol to become the industry protocol and for it to become industry protocol the largest number of health ecosystem participants need to be able to read and write data to this system.

Pharmacies have to pay 1 healthbit to the health chain foundation to bid on each prescription.

Health care researchers decide their own price for their research projects. 90% of the price goes to the patient and 10% goes to the health chain foundation.

The healthchain foundation uses the healthbits earned from pharmacies health tokens earned from patients and health care researchers to fund software developers developing the health chain protocol, pay for storage on the file coin network etc .

To bootstrap the network these are the bonus pools:

The patient bonus pool of 100 million tokens:
1. Every patient who joins the health chain network and books an valid appointment using the health chain network gets 10 health tokens.

MSP bonus pool of 100 million tokens:
1. Every time a clinician is onboarded they get 100 tokens 

Pharmacy bonus pool of 100 million tokens:
1. Every time a prescription is filled they get 1 token.

Every time the bonus pool halves the reward halves.
Every referral from an HC user who joins the network the HC user get 25% of the tokens earned by his referral.
